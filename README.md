Open Source JavaScript Media Galery (jQuery plugin)
---------------

Feel free to try it in any project and send me your feedback !

The idea is to make a multi-media galery, for photos, videos and others media,
to easily integrate in a project, as a jQuery plugin.

---------------

This allow you to add a galery :
- With controls (arrows)
- With navigation (pins)
- With thumbnails (physical thumbnails, if you have some)

----------------
- Only fade animation currently, others will come after

----------------
- Data management by direct array, or AJAX-loaded JSON file.
--> You just have to respect the parsing format

An online demo will come soon :)
